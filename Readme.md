Still a WIP, should release final V2 once I have the case.
TODO :

- switch LED to mini-e and change placement (right now it's interfering with the switches)
- optionnal 3D printed case


Done : 
-Fixed inverted SDA and SCK because of bad pro micro footprint
- change footprint of diodes to accept both SMD and through hole
- add holes in PCB and make .dxf for an FR4 plate.
- add a real reset button
