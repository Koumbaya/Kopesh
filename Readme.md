Still a WIP, should release final V1 once I have the case.
TODO : 
- add holes in PCB and make .dxf for an FR4 plate.
- qmk : oled and leds
- change footprint of diodes to accept both SMD and through hole
- switch LED to mini-e and change placement (right now it's interfering with the switches)
- add a real reset button
- optionnal 3D printed case


Done : Fixed inverted SDA and SCK because of bad pro micro footprint
