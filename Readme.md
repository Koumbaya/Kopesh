Still a WIP, should release final V2 once I have the case.

Gerbers file for the V2 are in gerbers/kopeshv2.zip
there is also a zip for the switchplate in FR4,
I need to add the gerbers for the backplate.

PCB should be ok on V2, just waiting for the order from JLCPCB

TODO : 
- qmk : leds
- optionnal 3D printed case


Done : 
-Fixed inverted SDA and SCK because of bad pro micro footprint
- change footprint of diodes to accept both SMD and through hole
- add holes in PCB and make .dxf for an FR4 plate.
- add a real reset button
- switch LED to mini-e and change placement (right now it's interfering with the switches)
